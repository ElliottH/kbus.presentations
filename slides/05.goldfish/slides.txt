A short introduction, with pictures

Goldfish A
----------

This is a metaphorical goldfish.

.. image:: 01_goldfish.png

Its name is A.

Goldfish B
----------

This is another metaphorical goldfish.

.. image:: 01_goldfish.png

*Its* name is B.

The bowl
--------
A and B live in a metaphorical goldfish bowl.

Bowls and KBUS devices
----------------------
Each metaphorical goldfish bowl has a KBUS device in it - this bowl has KBUS
device 0:

The fish in their bowl
----------------------
Here are the two fish in their bowl.

They are simple creatures
-------------------------
Metaphorical goldfish are simple creatures. They can only communicate with
each other using KBUS messages.

Another bowl
------------
Here is another metaphorical goldfish bowl. This one contains metaphorical
goldfish called R and G.

But the fish are lonely
-----------------------
Unfortunately, A and B cannot communicate with R and G. Even if the two
metaphorical goldfish bowls are running on the same computer, KBUS does not
permit sending KBUS messages between different KBUS devices.

But luckily we have Limpets
---------------------------
A Limpet lives on the side of a metaphorical goldfish bowl,
and communicates with another Limpet on another metphorical bowl:

What Limpets do
---------------
Limpets always come in pairs. Each Limpet can proxy KBUS messages from the
KBUS device in its metaphorical goldfish bowl to and from the other Limpet in
its pair. Think of them as using very low power line-of-sight lasers to send
messages between each other.

So a pair of Limpets hide the fact that the two KBUS devices are not the same.

So our fish are less lonely
---------------------------
This means that fish A and G can talk just as if they were in the same bowl:

   :width: 787px
   :height: 307px
   :scale: 66%
   :alt: Fish A talks to fish G, in another bowl

To the metaphorical goldfish, it is as if the messages magically pass between
the two KBUS devices, and thus A and B can communicate with R and G.

Even with more bowls
--------------------
This mechanism even allows such communication if there are intermediate bowls:

Keeping it simple
-----------------
In order to keep Limpets and their implementation as simple as possible, we're
willing to put up with some limitations.

Limitations: 1
--------------
Limpets come in pairs, and we're using sockets to communicate between
them, so we put up with one Limpet in each pair being a server, and the other a
client. This means we have to arrange for the server Limpet of a pair to
start first.

Limitations: 2
--------------
All Limpets on a connected network shall have unique ids, enabling us to
tell them apart. Requiring this allows us not to have some sort of name
server.

Limitations: 3
--------------
Limpets may not be used to form a network with loops in it. This means that
message propagation can be simplified (we don't have to worry about
messages ending up in infinite resend loops).

Limitations: 4
--------------
We assume a "safe" or trusted network. Limpets do not provide any
protection from other software "pretending" to be a Limpet (or, indeed, a
KBUS kernel module!). This is appropriate for the types of use we envisage.

Limitations: 5
--------------
One cannot connect both ends of a Limpet pair to the same KBUS
device (the same KBUS device number on different computers is OK, of
course). Really, don't - bad things will happen. You don't want to know.

Limitations: 6 (sort of)
------------------------
Oh, there is one other limitation. Neither KBUS nor Limpets address the
message *data*, which is assumed to be safe for any host-to-network or
network-to-host transitions.

.. class:: handout

  As KBUS itself does not address the content
  of any message data (with the exception of Replier Bind Events, mentioned
  later on), Limpets also do not do anything special with KBUS message data
  (with the same exception). In particular, they do not do any host-to-network
  or network-to-host manipulation of message data.

  This last may be lifted at some point in the future when ASN.1 bindings for
  KBUS data are provided (this is on our list), but for the moment if you are
  going to send messages between machines, assume that a text-based form (XML
  springs to mind) would be a good idea.
